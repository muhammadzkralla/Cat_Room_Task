# CAT
### Room migrations Task

In this task, you can find that the app database consists of two entities [Category and Note]. <br>
But as you can see in the structure of both entities, there's no relation between both, your job is to <br>
- Populate the database using the content.db found in the assets folder.
- Change in the structure of both entities to allow a relationship. Each note must be assigned to a category and all categories must have 20 notes at least.
- Use Room Migrations so we can keep the old data.
- After the migration is done and checked that it's working fine. Go to DetailsFragment and implement it (You will find a TODO on what it should contain).


## Bonus
While you are solving the task, you will find in some files that there are some TODOs annotated with (Bonus). <br>
Try to implement these additional tasks to maximize the experience.
